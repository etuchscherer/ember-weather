1. Clean up component structure/project directory layout
2. Add auto complete functionality(like google.com) (hard)
3. clicking enter should perform same behavior as clicking button
4. When searching for a city that does not exist, the screen does not change, 
   no error is thrown in console chrome, no error thrown in server log(essentially its completely silent). We'll want to log the error for devs and
   help users(helping users probably part of auto complete)
5. Background image should reflect city
6. Add more 'emberish' functionality, ideally with computed properties
7. Cache results from api(recording/mock api)
